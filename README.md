## musicClientOptions

| Option |Default|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`earProtections`|`true`|Using `false` will by pass the limit on the volume command, accepting volumes higher than `100`.|
|`loop`|`false`|Using `true` will set the loop setting enabled upon queue creation|
|`volume`|`30`|Volume based on `100`, such that the default setting will be `30/100` and thus make the volume safe for turning the music bot volume in discord to 100%. Tuning up the volume higher than `50` is not recommended. |
